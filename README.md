## 1. Introduction

Modern operating systems employ various CPU scheduling algorithms to efficiently manage and execute processes. This project aims to provide a hands-on experience of different scheduling strategies, such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Longest Job First (LJF), allowing users to explore their impact on system performance.

## 2. Features

- **Algorithm Selection:** Choose from a variety of CPU scheduling algorithms.
- **Dynamic Table:** Add or remove rows dynamically to input process details.
- **Interactive UI:** Easy-to-use interface for users to input data.
- **Visualizations:** View Gantt Charts and Time Graphs to understand scheduling results.
- **Average Completion Time Calculation:** Automatically calculate and display average completion and turnaround times.

## 3. Getting Started

### 3.1 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

### 3.2 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/os-scheduling-project.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## 4. Usage

### 4.1 Selecting Algorithms

Choose the desired CPU scheduling algorithm by selecting the corresponding radio button.

### 4.2 Entering Process Details

Enter process details such as Arrival Time and Burst Time in the provided form. Add or delete rows as needed.

### 4.3 Execution

Click the "Execute" button to trigger the scheduling algorithm and calculate the results.

### 4.4 Visualization

- **Gantt Chart:** View the Gantt Chart to understand the execution sequence.
- **Time Graph:** Explore the Time Graph for a graphical representation of process execution over time.
